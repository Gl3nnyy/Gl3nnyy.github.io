                    The dish is made with chicken that is marinated in a mixture of vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, peppercorns, and bay leaves, and then simmered in the same marinade until the chicken is tender and flavorful. 
                    The dish is usually served with steamed rice and can be garnished with sliced green onions or chopped cilantro.

                <p class="card-text">Kare-kare is a traditional Filipino dish that is popular for its rich and savory peanut sauce. The dish is made with oxtail, beef tripe, and various vegetables such as eggplant, string beans, and bok choy, all of which are stewed in a peanut sauce made with ground roasted peanuts, rice flour, and annatto seeds.
                     The sauce is typically thick and creamy, and the flavors are further enhanced by the addition of shrimp paste or bagoong.

                <p class="card-text">Sisig is a popular Filipino dish that originated in the Pampanga province. It is typically made with parts of the pig's head, such as the cheeks, ears, and snout, that are boiled, grilled, or fried, and then chopped into small pieces. The meat is then mixed with onions, garlic, chili peppers, and calamansi juice, which gives it a tangy and slightly sour flavor. 
                    Sisig is often served on a sizzling plate and topped with a raw egg that is mixed into the hot meat just before eating, creating a rich and creamy texture.
